        If I'm sick:
         -If itâ€™s after 9 PM I won't go out
         -If I have money I will buy medicine
         -if I don't have money - I will stay at home and drink tea

        if I'm healthy:
         -if I have between BGN 1 and 10 - I will go for coffee
         -if they are more than 10 leva - party all night
         -if I don't have 1 lev - I will stay at home and play games.

        Display the resulting solution as a message in the console.
